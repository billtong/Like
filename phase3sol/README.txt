Instructor's solution to Phase 3 of the 2021 course project,
a Semantic Analysis phase for the Like programming language.

You can compare and update your own Phase 3 solution using this one as a reference 
if you find that your own Phase 3 is not working well enough for you to work on Phase 4.

Of course, correct solutions need not be identical; they can be very different 
and still meet the specifications. 

If you cannot get your own Phase 3 solution working well enough to do Phase 4, 
you can use this solution as the input to your Phase 4 if you ask for permission to do so.
