# About
Like is a modular programming language with features similar to other modern languages like Ruby, Swift, Go, and Python. However, from our point of view, it is a modification and extension to PT Pascal. The main differences between PT and Like are new syntax for programs, statements and declarations, the addition of Like packages, the replacement of the char data type with the string data type, the removal of type declarations and the replacement of all built-in and named types with the like phrase, the addition of Like's elseif to if statements, the replacement of the PT repeat-until statement with Like's repeat-while statement, and the replacement of PT's case statement with Like's choose statement. Please see the Like language specification documents for more details.
